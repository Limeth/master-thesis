\section{Problem Statement}
This thesis is focused on the development of a \ac{VR} application that simulates select aspects of \acep{ASC}{further defined in \ref{sec:asc_definition}} typically induced by classical psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin/psilocin.
We focus primarily on the recreation of the \acp{ASC}' effects on sensory perception using an analytical approach.

\section{Motivation}
Due to their high degree of immersion, \ac{VR} systems, with \acp{HMD} in particular, offer a unique opportunity for recreating certain aspects of \acp{ASC}.

\subsection{Art and Media}
\Acp{ASC} of various forms have had a significant influence on art for millenia. Earliest signs of inductions of \acp{ASC} via neurotropic substances have been found possibly as early as 60,000 BC \autocite{guerra2015psychoactive}. \Acp{ASC} continue to be depicted in or influence contemporary popular media.

An analysis and a recreation of certain aspects of \acp{ASC} may serve as a reference point for recreating those aspects of \acp{ASC} in popular media.

\subsection{Education}
While experiencing a simulation of an \ac{ASC} is unlikely to be fully representative of the \ac{ASC} the simulation is modelled after, we propose that the simulation may be significantly less inducive of difficult experiences coloquially known as ''bad trips''.

This may be a viable alternative form of experiencing certain aspects of \acp{ASC}, while the possession or consumption of mind--altering substances is illegal in most countries. The resulting \ac{VR} application may serve as an educational tool about \acp{ASC} which would not require as controlled of an environment as is required in psychedelic--assisted psychotherapy.

\subsection{Research and Psychotherapy}
\textcite{aday2020psychedelics} make an interesting observation, that psychedelics and VR are utilized in tandem to enhance the experience of recreational users. Moreover, the authors claim that VR could also be used to optimize and tailor the therapeutic setting during psychedelic sessions.

Most importantly, however, the authors state, that:

\begin{quote}
    [...] VR may be a useful tool for preparing hallucinogen-na√Øve participants in clinical trials for the sensory distortions experienced in psychedelic states.
\end{quote}

Nonetheless, as mentioned previously, care should be taken to ensure that users experiencing the simulation are informed about the simulation not being fully representative of the \ac{ASC} it is modelled after. While a \ac{VR} simulation may be suitable for simulating sensory effects of \acp{ASC}, other effects, such as the effects on cognition, may be much more difficult, if not impossible, to directly replicate via \ac{VR} technologies alone. If uninformed, users may gain a false impression about the \ac{ASC}.

\subsection{Understanding of the Human Mind}
Finally, without any immediate application, the study of the effects of \acp{ASC} may help contribute to our understanding of the human mind. Particularly, for instance, analyzing the invariant effects of classical psychedelics on sensory perception may improve our understanding of the visual cortex and the way it functions.
Further research involving perceptual phenomena and pharmacodynamics of psychedelics and their mechanisms of action may contribute to our understanding of the significance of certain receptors in processing visual or other sensory information.

\section{Contributions}
We develop a \ac{VR} application for \acp{HMD} that simulates select aspects of \acp{ASC}.
We perform a study in which we measure the influence of the created \ac{VR} application on the human mind. This measurement is done via the \ace{11-ASC}{\textcite{studerus2010psychometric}}, that is used in clinical studies of psychedelic drugs.
