\section{Discussion}

\section{Notable Issues Encountered During Development}

\section{Limitations}
Low sample size, Experimental conditions (auditory noise)

\section{Future Work}
Larger sample size, Other aspects (time perception, synaesthesia), stronger hypothesis, eye tracking, hand tracking, body tracking, indoor scene, improvements for tracer effect, geometry/mesh shaders
