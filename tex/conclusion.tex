\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Discussion}
In this work, we have explored various contemporary attempts at replicating \acfp{ASC} induced by classical psychedelics. We have also explored potential applications of the replications of psychedelic-induced \acp{ASC}.

We created an application for immersive \acf{VR}, which is capable of producing a complex replication of a psychedelic-induced \ac{ASC}. This complex replication was a combination of partial replications of the following distincts aspects of \acp{ASC}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \item Depth Perception Distortion
    \item Visual Drifting
    \item Visual Acuity Enhancement
    \item Tracers (Visual Tracing)
\end{enumerate}

We measured the impact of the implemented complex replication with $N=10$ subjects on the scores of the \acf{5D-ASC} and the \acf{11-ASC}, and confirmed, that they are influenced by the implemented complex replication. This finding suggests, that \ac{VR} is an effective medium for the replication of certain aspects of \acp{ASC}.

\section{Limitations}
Low sample size, Experimental conditions (auditory noise)

\section{Future Work}
Larger sample size, Other aspects (time perception, synaesthesia), stronger hypothesis, eye tracking, hand tracking, body tracking, indoor scene, improvements for tracer effect, geometry/mesh shaders
