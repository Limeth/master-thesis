# [Simulating the phenomena of altered states of consciousness using virtual reality](thesis.pdf)

## Abstract

In this thesis, I explore contemporary attempts at the replication of various aspects of psychedelic-induced altered states of consciousness (ASCs) via software; primarily, the phenomena related to visual perception. Then, I describe my implementation of a replication, which simulates select aspects of a low-dose ASC induced by classical, serotonergic psychedelics, using immersive virtual reality (VR). I describe a study, which I have conducted in order to measure the impact of the resulting implementation on the results of psychometric questionnaires (5D-ASC, 11-ASC) typically used in the evaluation of subjective effects in clinical studies of psychedelics.
